# Spax-Dialogue-Thing
Unity Dialogue system using Ink, Mix and Jam's Animal Crossing Animated Text, and Dotween

Currently built int Unity 2020.2.0f, but it shoulf generally work for (almost) any version of Unity (I think).

This uses tags to do everything, so it might be really unintuitive. But I can promise that this system can do much more thatn your garen variety dialogue system.
You should only have 1 DialogueManager per scene, call StartDialogue in DialogueManager to start dialogue.
