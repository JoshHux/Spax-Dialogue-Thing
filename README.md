# Spax-Dialogue-Thing
Unity Dialogue system using Ink, Mix and Jam's Animal Crossing Animated Text, and Dotween

This system uses tags to do things like assign speakers, move characters across the screen, etc., the Ink file included is an example, so look over that. 
Call the StartDialogue method in the DialogueManager to start dialogue.
